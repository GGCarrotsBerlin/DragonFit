Hey Everyone, this is the git repository of Team Dragonfit.

We are a team of 6 members as :

We are in the process of creating a revolutionary app which helps parents and kids track fitness in a cool and gamified manner.

## Story:

Once upon a time there was a land of dragons. Dragons were very powerful, wise and were ruling a perfect world. World without wars, poverty and global warming. Unfortunately they have all died because of  the asteroid or other disaster, like dinosaurs, only three dragon eggs survived. You were chosen to take care of one of the eggs and grow a strong dragon, which will be ready to dominate a world and bring back order and happiness! 

How to do it? Dragon will take his strength from your healthy lifestyle! It is that simple! Just move a lot, sleep enough and watch your dragon growing! 

## Choose an egg and name it:

Choose an egg and name your future dragon. It will hatch as soon as you start to move, so go for a walk or do some sports and don’t forget to track it! 
 
## Recommendations:

 +	Don’t forget to grab a bottle of water while doing sports! Even if you just walk remember to drink minimum 6 glasses of water per day. 
 +	Did you know that you should eat five portions of fruits or veggies a day? Go grab an apple!
 +	Wondering how to gain more steps? Try to walk to school instead of taking a bus school instead of driving or taking a bus

Keep Calm and Keep Coding.

Cheers!

Team Dragonfit
